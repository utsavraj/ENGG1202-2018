Task 1: The attack matrix
-------

* Consider the board (0, 3, 2, 1). We have 16 possible ways to move one queen, where only 12 of them are valid moves, producing 12 different boards.
* If we count the number of attacking pairs of these moves, we have:

    1. Queen 0 to column 0: (not valid)
    2. Queen 0 to column 1: (1, 3, 2, 1), count: 4
    3. Queen 0 to column 2: (2, 3, 2, 1), count: 5
    4. Queen 0 to column 3: (3, 3, 2, 1), count: 4
    5. Queen 1 to column 0: (0, 0, 2, 1), count: 3
    6. Queen 1 to column 1: (0, 1, 2, 1), count: 5
    7. Queen 1 to column 2: (0, 2, 2, 1), count: 3
    8. Queen 1 to column 3: (not valid)
    9. Queen 2 to column 0: (0, 3, 0, 1), count: 3
    10. Queen 2 to column 1: (0, 3, 1, 1), count: 2
    11. Queen 2 to column 2: (not valid)
    12. Queen 2 to column 3: (0, 3, 3, 1), count: 2
    13. Queen 3 to column 0: (0, 3, 2, 0), count: 3
    14. Queen 3 to column 1: (not valid)
    15. Queen 3 to column 3: (0, 3, 2, 2), count: 3
    16. Queen 3 to column 4: (0, 3, 2, 3), count: 5

* If we put these numbers on the board, at the position where the queen was moved to, the result will be ::

    -  4  5  4
    3  5  3  -
    3  2  -  2
    3  -  3  5

* We can see that by moving the queen at row 2 to position 1 or 3, we will get the smallest attacking count among the 12 possible moves. Let's call this the attack matrix.
* For any board, we can count the number of pairs of attacking queens using this function ::

    def countAttack(queen):
        count = 0
        for row1 in range( 0, len(queen) ):
            for row2 in range( row1 + 1, len( queen ) ):
                if queen[row1] == queen[row2]:
                    count += 1
                elif abs(queen[row1] - queen[row2]) == (row2 - row1):
                    count += 1
        return count

You can use the above function in this and the following tasks.

* For this task, define the function printMatrix(queen) in nqueen.py with one parameter, queen.
* Parameter queen is a tuple representing a n-queen problem as described above.
* The function should print the corresponding attack matrix, with each value occupying 2 spaces, left-aligned.
* For example, you can test your function in main.py using the following code ::

    from nqueen import *
    printMatrix( (0, 3, 2, 1) )

which produces the output ::

    -  4  5  4
    3  5  3  -
    3  2  -  2
    3  -  3  5
    
* Not that your function should be able to handle boards of different sizes, e.g., ::

    from nqueen import *
    printMatrix( (0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1) )
    
which produces the output ::

    -  16 17 16 18 14 14 14
    14 16 14 -  12 12 12 15
    15 13 -  13 12 11 14 11
    13 -  13 15 11 15 11 11
    -  13 15 13 16 11 12 11
    14 16 14 -  12 14 12 13
    15 14 -  14 14 12 14 12
    15 -  15 17 13 15 13 15
    
* You can assume that the input queen is always a valid board, with all values less than the size of board.
* You can assume that the board will not exceed the size of 8.




Task 2: move one queen
-------

* Judging from the attack matrix shown for (0, 3, 2, 1) in the previous part, the lowest possible attack count of moving one queen will be 2.
* To solve a board using the local search method, we move one queen at a time based on the current best move. In this case, we will move queen 2 to position 1 or 3.
* Define the function moveOne(queen) in nqueen.py with one parameter, queen.
* Parameter queen is a tuple representing a n-queen problem as described above.
* The function should always move one queen based on the attack matrix and return the result.
* For example, for the case of (0, 3, 2, 1), the function should return either (0, 3, 1, 1) or (0, 3, 3, 1).
* The function should still move a queen if the move results in a higher attacking count.
* For example, you can test your function in main.py using the following code ::

    from nqueen import *
    queen1 = (0, 3, 2, 1)
    queen2 = moveOne( queen1 )
    printBoard(queen2)

    
which produces the output ::

    Q - - -
    - - - Q
    - Q - -
    - Q - -

* Note the use of printBoard() function provided at the beginning of this part of assignment.
* You can assume that the input queen is always a valid board, with all values less than the size of board.



Task 3: The attack matrix II
-------

* Suppose we further restrict the initial state so that no pair of queens are on the same row or the same column. Using the same representation, all values in the list will be distinct. For example, (1, 2, 0, 3) is a valid board ::

    - Q - -
    - - Q -
    Q - - -
    - - - Q
    
* Under such restriction, when we move one queen to a column, we have to swap the column position of such queen with the queen at the target column. For example, in the above case, if we move the queen at row 0 to column 0, we need to move the queen at row 2 to column 1 ::

    - Q - -       Q - - -     Q - - -
    - - Q -  -->  - - Q -  -> - - Q -
    Q - - -       Q - - -     - Q - -
    - - - Q       - - - Q     - - - Q
    
* The above operation is equivalent to a swap of position between queen 0 and queen 2. The board change from (1, 2, 0, 3) to (0, 2, 1, 3).
* Now we can repeat what we have done in the previous tasks.
* Consider the board (0, 3, 2, 1), we have 12 possible swaps, which produce 12 boards.
* If we count the number of attacking pairs of these swaps, we have:

    1. Queen 0 with queen 0: (not a swap)
    2. Queen 0 with queen 1: (3, 0, 2, 1), count: 1
    3. Queen 0 with queen 2: (2, 3, 0, 1), count: 4
    4. Queen 0 with queen 3: (1, 3, 2, 0), count: 1
    5. Queen 1 with queen 0: (3, 0, 2, 1), count: 1
    6. Queen 1 with queen 1: (not a swap)
    7. Queen 1 with queen 2: (0, 2, 3, 1), count: 1
    8. Queen 1 with queen 3: (0, 1, 2, 3), count: 6
    9. Queen 2 with queen 0: (2, 3, 0, 1), count: 4
    10. Queen 2 with queen 1: (0, 2, 3, 1), count: 1
    11. Queen 2 with queen 2: (not a swap)
    12. Queen 2 with queen 3: (0, 3, 1, 2), count: 1
    13. Queen 3 with queen 0: (1, 3, 2, 0), count: 1
    14. Queen 3 with queen 1: (0, 1, 2, 3), count: 6
    15. Queen 3 with queen 2: (0, 3, 1, 2), count: 1
    16. Queen 3 with queen 3: (not a swap)

The corresponding attack matrix will be ::

    -  1  4  1
    1  -  1  6
    4  1  -  1
    1  6  1  -

* Define the function printMatrix2(queen) in nqueen.py with one parameter, queen.
* Parameter queen is a list representing a n-queen board as described above.
* The function should print the corresponding attack matrix of swapping 2 queens as explained above, with each value occupying 2 spaces, left-aligned.
* For example, you can test your function in main.py using the following code ::

        from nqueen import *
        printMatrix2( (0, 3, 2, 1) )

which produces the output ::

    -  1  4  1
    1  -  1  6
    4  1  -  1
    1  6  1  -
    
* Similar to the first task, your function should be able to handle boards of different sizes, e.g., ::

    from nqueen import *
    printMatrix2( (0, 3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4) )
    
should produce the output ::

    -  9  10 9  9  6  6  9
    9  -  9  12 6  6  6  6
    10 9  -  9  5  5  5  5
    9  12 9  -  6  6  6  6
    9  6  5  6  -  8  8  10
    6  6  5  6  8  -  10 8
    6  6  5  6  8  10 -  8
    9  6  5  6  10 8  8  -
    
* You can assume that the input queen is always a valid board, with all values distinct and less than the size of board.


Task 4: swap queens
-------

* Similar to task 2, define the function moveTwo(queen) in nqueen.py with one parameter, queen.
* Parameter queen is a list representing a n-queen problem as described above.
* The function should always move two queens as described in task 3.
* For example, for the case of (0, 3, 2, 1), the function should return either (1, 3, 2, 0), (3, 0, 2, 1), or any other board with an attacking count of 1 after swapping the position of two queens.
* The function should still move two queens if the move results in a higher attacking count.
* For example, you can test your function in main.py using the following code ::

    from nqueen import *
    queen1 = (0, 3, 2, 1)
    queen2 = moveTwo( queen1 )
    printBoard(queen2)
    
which produces the output ::

    - - - Q
    Q - - -
    - - Q -
    - Q - -

* You can assume that the input queen is always a valid board, with all values distinct and less than the size of board.
* You can assume that the board will not exceed the size of 8.



Programming part 2: A* search
=====

Task 1: apply move
-------

* Define the function applyMove(state, move) in sortballs.py with two parameters, state, and move.
* Parameter state is a tuple representing a situation as described above.
* Parameter move is a string, which can be either "PUSH", "PULL", "SWAP", or "FLIP", representing the 4 operations described above.
* The function should return a new state by applying the specified move as described above.
* For example, if state is (2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5) and the move is PUSH, the function should return (0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5). It can be tested using the following code in main.py ::

    from sortballs import *
    state = (2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5)
    move = 'PUSH'
    print(applyMove(state, move))

which produces the output ::

    (0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5)
    
* If the specific move is not possible, e.g., there is no ball in the holder to swap, the function return a state that is identical to the input state. For example ::

    from sortballs import *
    state = (2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5)
    move = 'SWAP'
    print(applyMove(state, move))

which produces the output ::

    (2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5)
    
* You can assume that the input state is always a valid state, i.e., a tuple with values 0 to 5 in any order;
* You can assume that the input move is always a string of either 'PUSH', 'PULL, 'SWAP', or 'FLIP'.
